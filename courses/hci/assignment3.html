            <!-- Assignment 3-->
            <h1>Assignment 3</h1>
        <h3>Deadline: Check the calendar of your course shell</h3>
        <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
        <p>The learning objectives of this assignment are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning the procedure of evaluation</li>
            <li>Learning Usability Metrics</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Assignment Steps</h2>
        <h3>P1) Create a list of functionalities and update your prototype (25%)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                    Ask yourself <b>"What are the main functionalities of my application?"</b>

List 5-10 main functionalities. For example, for an audiobook app to be used during workout, the main functionalities are:
<ol>
    <li>
Basic operations to select/play/pause/fast-forward/fast-backward of audiobooks (with voice commands or touching the interface)
    </li>
    <li>
Taking notes from the book
    </li>
    <li>
Adding bookmarks
    </li>
    <li>
...
    </li>
    <li>
...
    </li>
</ol>

You can continue the above list with some other tasks that this application can do such as creating the profile for the user, change settings, etc. By the way, creating a profile or change settings are not really main functionalities of the app.
Therefore, really focus on main specific functionalities. 

<h3>COVID-19 app</h3>
For this semester, we had COVID-19 application. It should have some main functionalities such as registering as a volunteer to help others and also finding help if someone, such as a senior person needs it. Please add three more main functionalities based on your design.
            </li>
            

<h3>P1 - Delivarable</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Write top five functionalities of your application based on your specific design (two main functionalities are given above, volunteer registering and  seeking for help)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add navigation to your Figma prototype as it is described in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sAAa-CCOcg&list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7aqRW3Skp1aRT9ktC3ctqA"> these video tutorials.</a> to make your prototype <b>interactive and clickable</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Include your final <b>.fig</b> file in submission.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Watch this short video to see <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/2f1c38bf8f954e218877e1205d6d74e2">How to share URL of app in UserTesting or with the Testers </a>, and include the final link in your submission for part 1.
                </li>
            </ul>

        </ul>

        <h3>P2) Creating a Test Plan for three Participants(25%) </h3>

        <h4>Option 1: UserTesting.com</h4> 
        <ul>
        <li>
            Watch these video tutorial to learn <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/246bb98002d944acbd378f93461fb402">How To Create an Account</a> and <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/185bd3a576ac49e5a55778b8ead6adc8">How to create a Test Plan</a> 
        </li>

        </li>
        
        </ul>
        <h4>Option 2: Without UserTesting.com</h4> 
        <ul>
        <li>
            Watch  <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/185bd3a576ac49e5a55778b8ead6adc8">How to create a Test Plan</a> 
        </li>

        </li>
    </ul>

        <h4>Deliverable - P2</h4>
        Regardless of what option you choose you should provide the following: <br><br>
        <li>
            Three participant profiles, two for senior people (one male one and one female over 60 years old) and one person (male or female) between 18 and 40 years old as volunteer. Create some screener questions for each participant
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Three different Test Plans for your prototype based on five main functionalities and three different participants you created profile for them. Notice the prototypes are same for all participants, but tasks and scenarios and Test Plans are different because the participants are different. For example, for a senior person, they should have a task for seeking help, and for a volunteer they should register as a volunteer. Therefore, make sure you are designing the correct task for each participant.
        </li>
    </ul>

            <h3>P3) Usability Metrics and analyzing videos (50%)</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Option 1:</b> Watch <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/ee41e79adf5b404583b89a28680fa886">How To Launch Tests For Different Participants?</a> and launch your test for three participants using <b>Gift Codes</b>. Gift codes will be published as an announcment. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Option 2:</b>  The students who have privacy concerns for using the platform will have an option to create a test with the same strategies by themselves. Instead of using the above platform that finds participants automatically, they should find volunteers themselves who go through the tasks and record their interactions while they perform the tasks. You should Watch the <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/185bd3a576ac49e5a55778b8ead6adc8">overview of UserTesting</a>  I created, and create similar tasks or scenarios and ask them by yourself during the test. You should not help testers to complete the tasks and let them find out how to perform each task. You should create a report on what happened during the test and calculate the usability measurements yourself. Finally, you will share recorded videos and report the same way you did in Assignment 1. 

                You can have an online meeting with them using Zoom or similar, ask them to share their screen and you should record the screen (using OBS or similar application) to be shared later. You do NOT need to record faces. You should inform the users you are using this for research purposes, and receive the consent of recording as well. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Study <b><a href="UsabilityMetrics.pdf">"Usability Metrics"</a></b> article and based on the given guidelines, create some metrics. This article is just exploring some usability metrics you can apply. Please research about the other metrics, and find out what else you can include? Can you include number of clicks to complete a task for example? 
            </li>
        </ul>
            <ul>
            <h4>Deliverable - P3</h4>
            <li>
                Analyze the recorded videos based on three metrics you selected, and write a report simialr to what you see in pages 3-5 of <b> <a href="UsabilityMetrics.pdf">"Usability Metrics"</a></b> document. We do not have other designs to test and compare results with redesign, so simply in measurment metircs table just report your only test result metrics. Also, calculate average metrics if some tasks are common among different participants.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                You should share all recorded links (available inside the usertesting.com platform when you access recoreded videos or if you recorded by yourself, please upload them)
            </li>
             
          
            

            </ul>

        <hr>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <ul>
                <li>
                    All parts should be done and submitted <b>individually</b>
                </li>
               
                <li>
                    You should upload the final <b>.fig</b> file and on your GitHub repository. Make sure you create a new prototype and do not overwrite previous fig file you have.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You should submit a single PDF or Word document which contains P1, P2, P3 delivarables.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    The deadline is based on what you see on the course shell.
                </li>
                 <li>
                     Late submission will receive 10% deductions per 24 hours up to 72 hours. After 72 hours, 0 will be assigned.
