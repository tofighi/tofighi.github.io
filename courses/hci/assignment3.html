            <!-- Assignment 3-->
            <h1>Assignment 3</h1>
        <h3>Deadline: Check the calendar of your course shell</h3>
        <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
        <p>The learning objectives of this assignment are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning the procedure of evaluation</li>
            <li>Learning Usability Metrics</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Assignment Steps</h2>
        <h3>P1) Create a list of functionalities and update your prototype (25%)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                    Ask yourself <b>"What are the main functionalities of my application?"</b>

List 5-10 main functionalities. For example, for an audiobook app to be used during workout, the main functionalities are:
<ol>
    <li>
Basic operations to select/play/pause/fast-forward/fast-backward of audiobooks (with voice commands or touching the interface)
    </li>
    <li>
Taking notes from the book
    </li>
    <li>
Adding bookmarks
    </li>
    <li>
...
    </li>
    <li>
...
    </li>
</ol>

You can continue the above list with some other tasks that this application can do such as creating the profile for the user, change settings, etc. By the way, creating a profile or change settings are not really main functionalities of the app.
Therefore, really focus on main specific functionalities. 

            

<h3>P1 - Delivarable</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Write top five functionalities of your application based on your specific design
                </li>
                <li>
                    Complete navigation to your Figma prototype as it is described in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sAAa-CCOcg&list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7aqRW3Skp1aRT9ktC3ctqA"> these video tutorials.</a> to make your prototype <b>interactive and clickable</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Include your final <b>.fig</b> file in submission.
                </li>
            
            </ul>

        </ul>

        <h3>P2) Creating a Test Plan for two Participants(25%) </h3>

        
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4> 
        <ul>
       
        <li>
            You should complete this <a href="forms/TaskScript_Individual.docx">form</a> and use it during your test.
        </li>
        <li>
            You shuld use <a href="forms/ConsentForm.docx">this form</a> and attach to your assignment.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <h4>Deliverable - P2</h4>
         You should provide the following: <br><br>
        <li>
            Two participant profiles (it is better you test it with someone who is not family member or your friend, but if you cannot find anyone else it is acceptable)
        </li>
        <br>
       
       
        <li>
            <b>Important: </b>  you are required to attach completed <a href="forms/ConsentForm.docx">Consent Form</a> and <a href="forms/TaskScript_Individual.docx">Task Forms</a>. You can take a look at <a href="https://tofighi.github.io/courses/hci/assignment1.html">Clubber Application</a> example and create a task list similar to what you see there, but modify it for your own use.
        </li>
    </ul>
      
            <hr>

            <h3>P3) Usability Metrics and analyzing videos (50%)</h3>
            <ul>
            
            <li>
                <b>Steps:</b>  You should find volunteers yourself who go through the tasks and record their interactions while they perform the tasks. If you cannot find anyone, you can ask your classmates at Sheridan, familiy members, to help you evaluating your prototype.
                You should not help testers to complete the tasks and let them find out how to perform each task. You should create a report on what happened during the test and calculate the usability measurements yourself. Finally, you will share recorded videos and report the same way you did in Assignment 1. 

                You can have an online meeting with them using Zoom or similar, ask them to share their screen and you should record the screen (using OBS or similar application) to be shared later. You do NOT need to record faces. You should inform the users you are using this for research purposes, and receive the consent as well. Please use <a href="forms/ConsentForm.docx">this form</a> and attach to your assignment.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Study <b><a href="UsabilityMetrics.pdf">"Usability Metrics"</a></b> article and based on the given guidelines, create some metrics. This article is just exploring some usability metrics you can apply. Please research about the other metrics, and find out what else you can include? Can you include number of clicks to complete a task for example? 
            </li>
        </ul>
            <ul>
            <h4>Deliverable - P3</h4>
            <li>
                Analyze the recorded videos based on two metrics you selected, and write a report simialr to what you see in pages 3-5 of <b> <a href="UsabilityMetrics.pdf">"Usability Metrics"</a></b> document. We do not have other designs to test and compare results with redesign, so simply in measurment metircs table just report your only test result metrics. Also, calculate average metrics if some tasks are common among different participants.
            </li>
             
          
            

            </ul>

        <hr>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <ul>
                <li>
                    All parts should be done and submitted <b>individually</b>
                </li>
               
                <li>
                    You should upload the final <b>.fig</b> file and on your GitHub repository. Make sure you create a new prototype and do not overwrite previous fig file you have.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You should submit a single PDF or Word document which contains P1, P2, P3 delivarables.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    The deadline is based on what you see on the course shell.
                </li>
                 <li>
                     Late submission will receive 10% deductions per 24 hours up to 72 hours. After 72 hours, 0 will be assigned.
