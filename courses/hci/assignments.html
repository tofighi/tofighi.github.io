<body>
    <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
    <h3>Deadline: Check the calendar of your course shell</h3>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>The learning objectives of this assignment are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Learning the procedure of needfinding</li>
        <li>Learning the testing and evaluating procedure of a software</li>
        <li>Learning a prototyping software</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Assignment Steps</h2>
    
    <h3>P1) Procedure of NeedFining (5%)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Describe the software you are going to develop (at least 1 paragraph)
        </li>
        <li>
            Clearly mention the end users (audience) and platform you will develop the software
        </li>
        <li>
            Find similar successful websites/apps to your application, and investigate what users liked or disliked about the application or website. If your project is web-based, try to find out reviews for that website. You can also find applications similar to the web-app you will design.
        </li>
        <li>
            Find HCI-related papers and design aspects you need to consider for your audience. You can use Google Scholar and Sheridan Library. Mention at least 3 HCI concepts you need to consider for designing an application for your current audience.
        </li>
        <li>
            Study the <a href="need_finding.pdf"> <b>Need Finding</b></a> document and answer all the questions highlighted in blue. In addition, Follow the <b>"Steps of Needfinding"</b> and write your solution for each step.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>P2) Create a UserTesing Tester account and perform tests (2.5%)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Create a Tester account on <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/be-a-user-tester">UserTesing.com</a>. Share a screenshot of the feedback for your first test. You need to follow the website directions to become a good tester. It probably takes a week they get back to you by a feedback. The minimum is a feedback simlar what you see <a href="usertesting-feedback.png">here</a>.
            If you can do more tests, I will give you some bonus mark for evaluating more software, even if you will not receive the feedback. You just need to take screenshot from all tests you will perform.  
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>P3) Create a sample prototype using Adobe XD (2.5%)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
         Take any of the courses related to Adobe XD from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/topics/adobe-xd?u=2272289">Linkedin Learning</a>. Design the first 3 screens of your application and publish it online. When submitting the assignment, please include the link for the published application provided by Adobe XD. You do not need to include your Adobe XD files in this stage. Each of you in the group should design YOUR OWN first design based on what YOU individually think the app should look like. I expect some differences in your individual designs, so try not to share it with your teammate before the deadline of assignment!
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>P1 should be done in your group</li>
           <li>
               P2 and P3 should be done individually
           </li>
           <li>
               You need to submit the assignment individually. P1 is similar for your group, but P2 and P3 will be marked separately.
           </li>
           <li>
               The deadline is based on what you see on the course shell.
           </li>
           <li>
               You should submit a single PDF or Word document which contains P1, P2, P3.
            </li>
            <li>
                Late submission will receive 10% deductions per 24 hours up to 72 hours. After 72 hours, 0 will be assigned.
            </li>
        </ul>
