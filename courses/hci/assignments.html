        <h1>Assignment 2</h1>
        <h3>Deadline: Check the calendar of your course shell</h3>
        <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
        <p>The learning objectives of this assignment are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning the procedure of comprative analysis</li>
            <li>Creating the high fidelity prototype for your application</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Assignment Steps</h2>
        
        <h3>P1) Procedure of Competitive Analysis (5%)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                    Competitor analysis in marketing and strategic management is an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of current and potential competitors. This analysis provides both an offensive and defensive strategic context to identify opportunities and threats. Profiling combines all of the relevant sources of competitor analysis into one framework in the support of efficient and effective strategy formulation, implementation, monitoring and adjustment [<a href="http://assets.csom.umn.edu/assets/71542.pdf">1</a>].<br> 
                    In the first assignment, you provided similar applications to what you are going to develop. Regardless what you are developing, it is always possible to find the applications with similar themes. In this part, you need to compare your application with competitors in a matrix.<br> <b>Please write the name top three to five competitor apps</b>.<hr>
            </li>
            <li>
                    Use their products/services to understand how their business is structured.
                 <hr>
                </li>
            <li>
                Study <b><a href="CompetitiveAnalysis.pdf"> "A Product Designer's Guide to Competitive Analysis"</a></b> article and based on the given guidelines <b> draw the Competitor Analysis Matrix</b> while one of the columns is dedicated to your product.  A typical competitor analysis matrix contains the following (yours should at least contain them as well):
                <ol>
                <li>Features/solutions of the platform you are building.</li>
                <li> Confirmation that the competitors have/don’t have the same feature/solution.</li>
                <li>Score — you can assign a certain number of points to each of the features based on their importance. For example, in the sample above, chat may carry 10 points and stories may carry 5 points. Add all the points together and divide by the number of features =
                        competitor score in percentage. The visual design, overall user experience, and performance of each of the platforms
                        you analyzed may also be included.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <hr>
            </li>
            
            <li>
             Identify any UX/HCI issues with a competitor’s product and <b>create a comprehensive list of UX/HCI issues of your competitors here</b>. This list will help you learn from other people’s mistakes. After identifying UX issues, look for any visual design shortcomings. For example, how well are the calls to action designed and what kind of color palette are they using? This will help you design a better visual experience for your product. 
             <br>
             <b>Hint:</b> To find common UX/HCI issues, more than the main article,search for them. For example, you can find articles such as <a href="https://blog.appsee.com/9-usability-issues-that-plague-mobile-apps/">9 Usability Issues that Plague Today’s Mobile Apps</a> or <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/ux/problems-81412676">19 common UX problems and how to fix them</a>. 
             <hr>
            </li>

            <li>
                Identify any UX issues with <b>your initial prototype you and your teammates created</b> in the first assignment <b>create a comprehensive list of UX/HCI issues of your team prototypes here</b><hr>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>P2) Your first high fidelity prototype using Adobe XD(2.5%)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Study <b><a href="PrototypeDesign.pdf">Perfect Your UX Design Process – A Guide to Prototype Design</a></b> to learn about steps of creating a prototype. In collaboration with your teammates, choose the best ideas of your first designs in your team and remove the issues you made in first design.<br>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Provide screenshots of your final design which contains all the features of the app you are designing.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Provide a public URL of your ADOBE XD design.</b> The prototype should be workable (clicking on the menus, icons,etc should show the interface or move to the next screen)
                    It is much better you publish the URL of prototype publicly. If you need to invite me to keep your design private, use my sheridan email address to share (ghassem.tofighi at sheridancollege.ca)</li>
                    <li><b>Create a video of Interactions with Audio Narration, and upload to YouTube. Go through all the screens and talk about what app is capble of. You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AMBEeoy8s">this video</a> to see how.</b> Provide the 
                    </li>URL of video here. Please make video public, and for any reasons if you want to keep it private, make the video Unlisted. Unlisted in YouTube means just it is accessible by having the URL.
                </ol>
                
            </li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>P3) Class Activity - Mandatory Attendance (2.5%)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
             <b>Attend the class to work with your teammates on prototype design in P2</b>. If you have teammates in another section, you still need to attend and work on the assignment individually. At the end of session, you will submit the screenshots of the work in class individually. The deadline of this part is in the session which will be announced. It CANNOT be done outside of the classroom.
            </li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Submission</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>P1 should be done in your group, and should be submitted <b>BEFORE the deadline of P1</b>.  The deadline for both sessions is similar. Questions will be asked from the team members and I will mark each of you individually to see what parts you contributed.</li>
               <li>
                   You need to submit a similar assignment in your team, but individually.
               </li>
               <li>
                   The deadlines are based on what you see on the course shell.
               </li>
                <li>
                   You should submit <b>three PDF</b> documents each contains P1, P2, P3 before each part deadline. For P1 and P3, submission after deadlines will not receive any marks. P2 will receive 10% deductions per 24 hours up to 72 hours. After 72 hours, 0 will be assigned.</b>

    <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
    <h3>Deadline: Check the calendar of your course shell</h3>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>The learning objectives of this assignment are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Learning the procedure of needfinding</li>
        <li>Learning the testing and evaluating procedure of a software</li>
        <li>Learning a prototyping software</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Assignment Steps</h2>
    
    <h3>P1) Procedure of NeedFining (5%)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Describe the software you are going to develop (at least 1 paragraph)
        </li>
        <li>
            Clearly mention the end users (audience) and platform you will develop the software
        </li>
        <li>
            Find similar successful websites/apps to your application, and investigate what users liked or disliked about the application or website. If your project is web-based, try to find out reviews for that website. You can also find applications similar to the web-app you will design.
        </li>
        <li>
            Find HCI-related papers and design aspects you need to consider for your audience. You can use Google Scholar and Sheridan Library. Mention at least 3 HCI concepts you need to consider for designing an application for your current audience.
        </li>
        <li>
            Study the <a href="need_finding.pdf"> <b>Need Finding</b></a> document and answer all the questions highlighted in blue. In addition, Follow the <b>"Steps of Needfinding"</b> and write your solution for each step.
        </li>
