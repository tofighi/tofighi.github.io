            <h3>P2) Procedure of Competitive Analysis (25%)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                        Competitor analysis in marketing and strategic management is an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of current and potential competitors. This analysis provides both an offensive and defensive strategic context to identify opportunities and threats. Profiling combines all of the relevant sources of competitor analysis into one framework in the support of efficient and effective strategy formulation, implementation, monitoring and adjustment [<a href="http://assets.csom.umn.edu/assets/71542.pdf">1</a>].<br> 
                        In the first assignment, you provided similar applications to what you are going to develop. Regardless what you are developing, it is always possible to find the applications with similar themes. In this part, you need to compare your application with competitors in a matrix.<br> <b>Please write the name top five competitor apps</b>.<hr>
                </li>
                <li>
                        Use their products/services to understand how their business is structured.
                     <hr>
                    </li>
                <li>
                    Study <b><a href="CompetitiveAnalysis.pdf"> "A Product Designer's Guide to Competitive Analysis"</a></b> article and based on the given guidelines <b> draw the Competitor Analysis Matrix</b> while one of the columns is dedicated to your product.  A typical competitor analysis matrix contains the following (yours should at least contain them as well):
                    <ol>
                    <li>Features/solutions of the platform you are building.</li>
                    <li> Confirmation that the competitors have/don’t have the same feature/solution.</li>
                    <li>Score — you can assign a certain number of points to each of the features based on their importance. For example, in the sample above, chat may carry 10 points and stories may carry 5 points. Add all the points together and divide by the number of features =
                            competitor score in percentage. The visual design, overall user experience, and performance of each of the platforms
                            you analyzed may also be included.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <hr>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                 Identify any UX/HCI issues with a competitor’s product and <b>create a comprehensive list of UX/HCI issues of your competitors here</b>. This list will help you learn from other people’s mistakes. After identifying UX issues, look for any visual design shortcomings. For example, how well are the calls to action designed and what kind of color palette are they using? This will help you design a better visual experience for your product. 
                 <br>
                 <b>Hint:</b> To find common UX/HCI issues, more than the main article,search for them. For example, you can find articles such as <a href="https://blog.appsee.com/9-usability-issues-that-plague-mobile-apps/">9 Usability Issues that Plague Today’s Mobile Apps</a> or <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/ux/problems-81412676">19 common UX problems and how to fix them</a>.

                </li>
    
                <li>
                    Identify any UX issues with <b>your initial prototype you created</b> in the first assignment  and create a list of UX/HCI issues of your prototype here</b><hr>
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h3>P3) Your second prototype using Figma(25%)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Do NOT overwrite your first design. Copy what you created in first assignment, and start working on a separate copy of your design.</li>
                <li>
                    Study <b><a href="PrototypeDesign.pdf">Perfect Your UX Design Process – A Guide to Prototype Design</a></b> to learn about steps of creating a better prototype. Choose the best ideas of your first design and remove the issues you made in first design.<br>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Provide screenshots of your final design which contains all the features of the app you are designing.</b></li>
                        <li><b>Provide a public URL of your Figma design.</b> The prototype should be workable (clicking on the menus, icons,etc should show the interface or move to the next screen)
                        </li>
                        <li>Create a video of interactions with audio narration, and upload to YouTube (Or upload on Slate/OneDrive if you have privacy concerns). Go through all the screens and talk about what app is capble of. You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8qRG6I26C0">this video</a> to see how to record it or simply use <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a>.</b> Provide the 
                        URL of video in the document.</li>
                    </ol>
