    <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
    <h3>Deadline: Check the calendar of your course shell</h3>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>The learning objectives of this assignment are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Learning a prototyping software</li>
        <li>Learning the testing and evaluating procedure of a software</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Assignment Steps</h2>
    
  
    <h3>P1) Create a sample prototype using Figma (70%)</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Review the contents of Module 1</li>
    <li><a rel="noopener" href="https://www.figma.com/downloads/" target="_blank">Install Figma</a> and activate <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.figma.com/education/" target="_blank">your educational license with your Sheridan email address</a></li>
    <li>Watch <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?forceAccount=false&amp;redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Ffigma-for-ux-design-2%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url&amp;account=2272289" target="_blank">this LinkedIn Learning course</a> completely and perform all activities</li>
    <li>Design a <b>clickable</b> mobile app prototype (
        Add navigation to your Figma prototype as it is described in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sAAa-CCOcg&list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7aqRW3Skp1aRT9ktC3ctqA"> these video tutorials.</a> to make your prototype <b>interactive and clickable</b>) with at least 10 different screens using Figma based on what you learned from the LinkedIn Learning course with the following features <strong>(You just design the prototype, no programming is required!)</strong>:
    <ul>
    <li>Show the statistics of COVID 19 cases in Canada and Ontario</li>
    <li>Show some guides</li> 
    <li>Imagine the above app has a new feature that lets seniors/people in need to inform others to help them. Use your creativity to design screens to implement this feature. Decide how people in need should use your app to inform others about their needs. make those screens in your app. In addition how volunteers should find them and their needs and chat with them in the app to offer help. (include these screens as well)
    </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
   
    <li><strong>Share a public link of your Figma design in the deisgn and fig file</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>P2) Perform one of the following options (30%)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> <b>Option 1:  <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/be-a-user-tester">UserTesting.com</a> </b> 
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li> Create a Tester account on <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/be-a-user-tester">UserTesting.com</a> with an email which is <b>NOT your Sheridan email address</b> (for example, use your Gmail account). Share a screenshot of the feedback for your first test. You need to follow the website directions to become a good tester. It probably takes a week they get back to you by a feedback. The minimum is a feedback simlar what you see <a href="usertesting-feedback.png">here</a>.<b>
                    In the case you did not receive feedback by deadline, just share a screenshopt of confirmation email for the test you performed.</b>
                If you can do more tests, I will give you some bonus mark for evaluating more software, even if you will not receive the feedback. You just need to take screenshot from all tests you will perform.  
                 </li>


            </ul>

           
        </li>
        <br>

        <li> <b>Option 2:</b> Please record your screen and microphone while performing the following tasks and <b>"think out load"</b> and if anything is confusing in the app explain it. After you are done with recording, upload your video to slate (or your Sheridan OneDrive and put the link). You can use <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> for recording the screen and microphone. <br> <br>
            
                <ul> 

                <li> 
                  <b>Scenario:</b>  
                    You are using the <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/fa3f8686-3d6a-4c16-45ea-adf578882dfd-8c0e/" target="_blank">Clubber application</a>, an app that allows you, as a student, to join clubs, add events to your calendar, start a new club, start a new event, and create posts in clubs. As a club coordinator/administrator, you will be able to approve club start-up forms, event forms, promotional material forms, change the tier/level of a club, and provide announcements to students. Imagine that as a student, you want to use the app to join a club, an event, start a new club, start a new event, and provide a post in your newly created club. Imagine that as a club coordinator/administrator, you want to approve a club start-up form, change the tier of a club, and post a new announcement for students to read.

                        <li>
                            You will be using a prototype: a design that's not completely finished yet. You can interact with it just like you would any other mobile app. If something does not work, explain what you would expect to happen and move on. <br>
                            <b>Verbally acknowledge that you understand the limitations of the prototype.</b> <br>
                            Log in or sign up as John Doe. By clicking on the text input boxes, the credentials should be automatically filled in. As a student, find the Baseball Club and join it.  <br>
