        <li>Learning a prototyping software</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Assignment Steps</h2>
    
  
    <h3>P1) Create a sample prototype using Figma (30%)</h3>
    <ul>

    <ul>
    <li>Show the statistics of COVID 19 cases in Canada and Ontario</li>
    <li>Show some guides</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Imagine the above app has a new feature that lets seniors/people in need to inform others to help them. Use your creativity to design screens to implement this feature. Decide how people in need should use your app to inform others about their needs. make those screens in your app. In addition how volunteers should find them and their needs and chat with them in the app to offer help.</li>
    <li><strong>Share a public link of your Figma design in the deisgn and fig file</strong></li>
    </ul>

Share a screenshot of the feedback for your first test. You need to follow the website directions to become a good tester. It probably takes a week they get back to you by a feedback. The minimum is a feedback simlar what you see <a href="usertesting-feedback.png">here</a>.
            If you can do more tests, I will give you some bonus mark for evaluating more software, even if you will not receive the feedback. You just need to take screenshot from all tests you will perform.
