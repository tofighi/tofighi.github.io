    <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
    <h3>Deadline: Check the calendar of your course shell</h3>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>The learning objectives of this assignment are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Learning a prototyping software</li>
        <li>Learning the testing and evaluating procedure of a software</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Assignment Steps</h2>
    
  
    <h3>P1) Create a sample prototype using Figma (70%)</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Review the contents of Module 1</li>
    <li><a rel="noopener" href="https://www.figma.com/downloads/" target="_blank">Install Figma</a> and activate <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.figma.com/education/" target="_blank">your educational license with your Sheridan email address</a></li>
    <li>Watch <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?forceAccount=false&amp;redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Ffigma-for-ux-design-2%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url&amp;account=2272289" target="_blank">this LinkedIn Learning course</a> completely and perform all activities</li>
    <li>Design a <b>clickable</b> mobile app prototype (
        Add navigation to your Figma prototype as it is described in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sAAa-CCOcg&list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7aqRW3Skp1aRT9ktC3ctqA"> these video tutorials.</a> to make your prototype <b>interactive and clickable</b>) with at least 5 different screens using Figma based on what you learned from the LinkedIn Learning course with the following features <strong>(You just design the prototype, no programming is required!)</strong>:
    
    <h2>Sheridan Courses App</h2>
    <p>Your goal is designing an intuitive mobile application for courses at Sheridan College. In addition to college students who are usually between 18 to 30 years old, you should consider the <a href="https://caps.sheridancollege.ca/">continuing education courses</a> that learners are above 45 years old and are not tech savvy.</p>
    <p>Design your first prototype that:</p>
    <ul>
        
    <li>Shows the course list (at least 1 screen)</li>
    <li>Shows an individual course screen (at least 1 screen)</li>
    <li>Shows the assignment screen for a course (at least 1 screen)</li> 
    <li>Has a new feature that lets students in each course have a separate group chat. Show how you include it in your app (at least 2 screens)
    </li>
    <li>Menus, icons, etc are based on your own creativity and understanding of HCI concepts until now, especially by considering the end users
    </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <br>
   
 
    </ul>

    <h3>P2) Testing a prototype (30%)</h3>
    <ul>

        <li> <b>Note:</b> Please record your screen and microphone while performing the following tasks and <b>"think out loud"</b>. If anything is confusing in the app explain it. <b>Please do not send me email that you think a part of app is missing or you are not able to complete the task. Explain in video what is confusing or what you could not complete! This is part of the test :-)</b> <br> After you are done with recording, upload your video to slate (or your Sheridan OneDrive and put the link). You can use <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> for recording the screen and microphone. <br> <br>
            
                <ul> 

                <li> 
                  <b>Scenario:</b>  
                    You are using the <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/fa3f8686-3d6a-4c16-45ea-adf578882dfd-8c0e/" target="_blank">Clubber application</a>, an app that allows you, as a student, to join clubs, add events to your calendar, start a new club, start a new event, and create posts in clubs. As a club coordinator/administrator, you will be able to approve club start-up forms, event forms, promotional material forms, change the tier/level of a club, and provide announcements to students. Imagine that as a student, you want to use the app to join a club, an event, start a new club, start a new event, and provide a post in your newly created club. Imagine that as a club coordinator/administrator, you want to approve a club start-up form, change the tier of a club, and post a new announcement for students to read.

                <li> <b>Tasks</b> 
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            You will be using a prototype: a design that's not completely finished yet. You can interact with it just like you would any other mobile app. If something does not work, explain what you would expect to happen and move on. <br>
                            <b>Verbally acknowledge that you understand the limitations of the prototype.</b> <br>
                            Log in or sign up as John Doe. By clicking on the text input boxes, the credentials should be automatically filled in. As a student, find the Baseball Club and join it.  <br>

                            The Baseball Club has increased in terms of the number of members. You want to give them more resources. In order to do this, you must increase the tier of the club. Assign the Baseball Club to tier 3.
